# NextJS BankID

This is a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project showing you how to integrate BankID authentication to your app. I have included test certificates in the `cert` folder but I advise you to go to the [BankID Developer Website](https://developers.bankid.com/) and get your own certificates. 

## Getting Started

First, simply install the packages:

```bash
npm i
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/auth](http://localhost:3000/auth) with your browser to see the result.
